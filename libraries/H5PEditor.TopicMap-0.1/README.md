## Merging Strategy:

In this project we use rebase merging without fast-forwarding when closing pull requests as standard. After completing the review process, close pull requests with the following steps:

1. Add new comment: `/rebase` to the pull request that is ready to be merged. Fix merge conflicts if there are any.
2. Click **Merge pull request** to close the pull request after github-actions bot force-pushed the branch (if a rebase was necessary).

Note: do not use **Rebase and merge** to avoid using fast-forwarding.
